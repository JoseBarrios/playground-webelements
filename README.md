# playground-webelements
Privileged web-elements playground (privileged as in: semi-private).

Requirements:

- Localhost (comes with Express out of the box, but you can use whatever as long as you serve the public folder)
- Works in: Chrome (others are still working on their web-components implementation)
- This is a playground experiment. It should NEVER be used in staging or production

Quickstart:

If you're using Node and NPM, just run:
$ npm install; node server.js;

If you're using something else:
- Start a server
- Serve public folder
- Have fun, and don't break too many things.
